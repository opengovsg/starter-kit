# Client theming

This application uses the [OGP Design System](https://github.com/opengovsg/design-system/tree/main/react), and as such the relevant documentation can be found in their README.

## Customising the theme

The theme can be customised by editing the `theme` object in [src/client/theme.ts](../../../src/theme/index.ts).

> 🗒️ If your product has a custom theme (inquire with your designer!), a custom `theme` object may have already been created for the product.

A list of all current custom themes can be found in the `token-gen/themes` directory of the design system repository [here](https://github.com/opengovsg/design-system/tree/main/token-gen/themes).

The documentation on how to apply the custom themes can also be found in the README of the `token-gen` directory in the design system, linked [here](https://github.com/opengovsg/design-system/tree/main/token-gen) for convenience.
